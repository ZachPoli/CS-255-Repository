The DriverPass project aimed to design a holistic training system for individuals preparing for driving tests. The client, DriverPass, sought a solution to combat high test failure rates by providing online practice exams, on-road training, and educational resources. This comprehensive system also required user authentication, role-based access control, DMV integration, robust security measures, and an intuitive web interface. My strengths in this project included precise user requirement interpretation and clear documentation with UML diagrams. However, I would improve the UML diagrams by enhancing visual intuitiveness. Interpreting user needs is paramount, as it ensures system usability and effectiveness. My design approach involves systematic requirements analysis, documentation, and iterative design, with a focus on user-centricity. In the future, I will maintain this approach, emphasizing client communication, staying updated with best practices, and usability testing.
